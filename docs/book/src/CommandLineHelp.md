```text

(1) Paul's Dream (Dune) - Caster -> <https://listenbrainz.org/user/user/?min_ts=1709228551&max_ts=1709228553>

(7) Raise Your Weapon - KLOUD -> <https://listenbrainz.org/user/user/?min_ts=1709824520&max_ts=1709824522>

Total: 8 unlinked recordings

```

> Note: Listens are grouped by "Messybrainz ID" (MSID). This is the way Listenbrainz recognize similar listens > by attributing them the same MSID. Linking a listen will link the others as long as they have the same MSID.

> This also means that the same recording can be shown twice in the list. > For example: "Panic - Dion Timer" won't have the same MSID as "Panic by Dion Timmer", even if they are the same recording.

## `alistral radio underrated`

Generate a playlist containing your underrated listens

This radio will create a playlist containing all the tracks that you listen to, but seemingly no one else does.

> The mix is made by calculating a score for each listen. This score is composed of two values: > - The rank in the user's top 1000 recording of all time (First place get 100 points, second get 999.9, etc...) > - The percentage of the recording's listens being from the user (Made with this formula: (user listens / worldwide listens) *100)

**Usage:** `alistral radio underrated [OPTIONS] [USERNAME]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<USERNAME>` — Name of the user to fetch listens from

###### **Options:**

* `-t`, `--token <TOKEN>` — Your user token.

   You can find it at <https://listenbrainz.org/settings/>. If it's set in the config file, you can ignore this argument



## `alistral radio rate`

Generate playlists depending on the listen rate of recordings

This algorythm bases itself on your listen rate of recording to get more forgotten tracks. It takes the recordings with the lowest listen rates, and put them into a playlist

**Usage:** `alistral radio rate [OPTIONS] [USERNAME]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<USERNAME>` — Name of the user to fetch listens from

###### **Options:**

* `-t`, `--token <TOKEN>` — Your user token.

   You can find it at <https://listenbrainz.org/settings/>. If it's set in the config file, you can ignore this argument

  Default value: `0`



## `alistral radio overdue`

Generate playlists based on recording that the user should have listened to by now

Similar to listen rates, this algorithm calculate the average time between listens, and estimate when the next listen will happen. It then put together a playlist made out of recordings you should have listened by now.

**Usage:** `alistral radio overdue [OPTIONS] [USERNAME]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<USERNAME>` — Name of the user to fetch listens from

###### **Options:**

* `-t`, `--token <TOKEN>` — Your user token.

   You can find it at <https://listenbrainz.org/settings/>. If it's set in the config file, you can ignore this argument
* `--min <MIN>` — Minimum listen count
* `-c`, `--cooldown <COOLDOWN>` — The amount of hours needed to wait after a recording have been given before it is re-suggested

  Default value: `0`
* `-o`, `--overdue-factor` — Sort the recordings by the time overdue / the average time between listens

   Instead of sorting by date, the listens are sorted by how many estimated listens should have happened by now (Time elapsed since last listen / Average time per listens)

  Default value: `false`
* `-a`, `--at-listening-time` — Makes `overdue_factor` more accurate by calculating the score at the time the listen will be listened at instead of now.

   This may slowdown the playlist creation by a lot!

  Default value: `false`



## `alistral radio shared`

Generate playlists based on the listened recordings of two users

**Usage:** `alistral radio shared [OPTIONS] <USERNAME_A> <USERNAME_B>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<USERNAME_A>`

* `--min <MIN>` — Minimum listen count
* `-c`, `--cooldown <COOLDOWN>` — The amount of hours needed to wait after a recording have been given before it is re-suggested

  Default value: `0`
